# film-library
a simple c# film library

## Define the Film Class:

Create a class called "Film" to represent a film in the library.
Include properties such as Title, Director, ReleaseYear, Genre, and Duration.
Implement appropriate getter and setter methods for the properties.

### Create the Film Library Class:

Create a class called "FilmLibrary" to manage the collection of films.
Declare a private List<Film> field to store the films in the library.
Implement methods to add a film, remove a film, and retrieve a list of all films.
Implement additional methods for searching and sorting films based on different criteria, such as title, director, or genre.

### Implement the Film Library Console Application:

Create a console application that interacts with the FilmLibrary class.
Provide a user-friendly menu system to perform various operations.
Allow the user to add films, remove films, list all films, search films, and sort films.
Handle input validation and provide appropriate error messages.

###  Implement File I/O Operations:

Add methods to the FilmLibrary class to save and load the film library to/from a file.
Use serialization (e.g., XML or JSON) to persist the film library data.
Implement error handling for file I/O operations.

### Create a User Interface (Optional):

Consider creating a graphical user interface (GUI) using a framework like Windows Forms or WPF.
Design a visually appealing interface to display and interact with the film library.
Implement event handlers and bindings to connect the GUI with the FilmLibrary class.

### Test and Debug:

Write unit tests to validate the functionality of individual methods.
Test the application by adding, removing, searching, and sorting films.
Debug any issues or errors that arise during testing.
### Refactor and Optimize:

Review your code for any redundancies, inefficiencies, or code smells.
Refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
Optimize any bottlenecks or areas that can be improved.

### Documentation:

Provide documentation for the classes, methods, and important code sections.
Include comments explaining the purpose, inputs, and outputs of the functions.
Write a user guide or README file to help others understand and use your film library.
Remember to follow good programming practices, such as using meaningful variable and method names, following coding conventions, and organizing your code into logical modules or namespaces.
